### Scope:

Container technologies such as Docker is letting astronomers easily share, scale, and reuse software.  Jupyter Notebook is letting astronomers organize and reproduce data analysis.  Together, these technologies make reproducible astronomy possible.  The first PIRE Mini-Hackathon, *Docker and Jupyter for Reproducible Astronomy*, gives PIRE and EHT members hands-on experiences on using these technologies to make their analysis reproducible.

### BYOD/BYOA:

**B**ring **Y**our **O**wn **D**ata and **A**nalyses.  Hackathon participants are encouraged to bring their own data and analytical workflows for containerization.

### Required Experience:

- Linux command line, directory structures, shell commands
- Basic programming experience (language of your choice)

### Outcomes:

- Basic knowledge of container technologies and Jupyter Notebook
- How to run containized software
- How to containerize software
- Able to develop self-contained, portable, and reproducible Docker containers and Jupyter notebooks
